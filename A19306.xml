         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:227:12"/> an honorable Counſellour, which alſo looked for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, came and went in boldly vnto Pilate, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the body of Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This noble Counſellour by all the Euangeliſts is thus diſcribed. Firſt, his dwelling place is to vs noted, which was a famous Citie of the Iewes, for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramathaea</hi> (ſuppoſed to be the ſame which was alſo before called <hi>Ramath,</hi> layde oute for the Citie of the <hi>Leuites</hi> by <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, ſytuate about the Mounte <hi>Ephraim,</hi> néere to <hi>Lydda,</hi> which after was called <hi>Dioſpolis.</hi>). Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his condition and lyfe, by condition Noble, for he <hi>was an honorable Counſellour,</hi> eyther of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or called to <hi>Pilats</hi> Counſell. Concerning godly cyuilitie, he was honeſt, a good man and a iuſte. Touching his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was a diſciple of Ieſu, and <hi>wayted</hi> with <hi>Symeon</hi> for the kingdome of God, that is, for his redemption in Chriſt his Lord and Mayſter. Concerning his faythfull ſeruice to his Mayſter Chriſt our Lorde, he withſtoode the Counſell boldly (as did alſo <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) and when he coulde not preuayle, he openly refuſed to gyue his conſent to them in the death of Chriſt (for the Euangeliſt ſpeaketh of a thing that was knowne to all men.) His infirmitie was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what great in déede, that <hi>hee durſt not confeſſe Chriſt for feare of the Iewes.</hi> But his modeſtie was more, that being of ſuch place and power, he reſiſted not the Magiſtrate by ſworde for the cauſe of Chriſt, being a ſubiect to that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous power, or with haultie wordes, or conuitious ſpéeche, gaue counterchecke to their curſſed blaſphemies, but manifeſtly refuſed to allowe of that murthering Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. To giue you this man wholy in his vertues. As he refuſed to kyll Chriſt by cruell ſentence. So Chriſt being ſlayne, he ſheweth himſelfe more faythfull and bold in the cauſe of Chriſt, then eyther the Virgin Mary, or any other of the Apoſtles. For as ſaint <hi>Marke</hi> ſayth. <hi>He went with great boldneſſe</hi> to that diſſembling Tyran <hi>Pilate,</hi> in the heate of the Iewes rage, and honorably obtayneth the
<pb facs="tcp:227:12"/> body of Ieſu to be buryed and the ſame layeth in his owne graue honorably prepared for himſelfe. This was to his ſtate very dangerous. For in that he maketh ſute to honor him with buriall, whome the Preſidente, Princes, and people of the Iewes, had condemned to death, and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed therevnto, what might they accompt of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> other, then that this his peticion gaue flat condemnation to their preſent action? What was he? and where dwelte he? That did or durſt begge with boldneſſe the bones of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Bucer,</hi> which the Papiſts in their rage and great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie burnte at <hi>Cambridge?</hi> By this meaſure, howe bolde and aduenturous attempte this was in this Noble Counſellour, his honor, ryches, place, and calling conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Beſides this, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> myght haue founde ſome better and more eaſie waye to haue obteyned his purpoſe, to haue done that honor to the ſlayne bodye of Chriſt, whome he durſt not confeſſe during his lyfe. As he might haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Iewes, where (their crueltie ended) they woulde haue caſte the deade bodye of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſte, and by night haue priuely conuayed the ſame to hys Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture, or to haue procured fauour of the Centurion for money, to haue bought the bodye of the Lorde, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyblie might as wel haue come to paſſe, as the high Prieſts to corrupt the Souldiours for money,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.13.</note> to ſaye that <hi>his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſtole him away by night.</hi> This might fleſhe &amp; bloude in infyrmitie of Nature, haue perſwaded this Princely Péere in God. But the wiſedome of God hath otherwiſe determyned, and therefore at a ſodaine changed the harte of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and of a priuie and quaking Diſciple, made hym an open and moſt Heroycall ſpirited Souldiour, all which holy <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth of purpoſe, in theſe words.<note place="margin">Luc. 23.50</note> 
               <hi>Tum ecce vir nomine Ioſeph, &amp;c.</hi> As if he would ſaye, beholde nowe a maruellous matter and ſodayne mutation,<note place="margin">A chriſtian courage in a Noble counſellour.</note> beyonde the expectation of all men, come to paſſe. When the matters of Chriſt the Lorde were thus in hande, that he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfied, ſlayne, and dead vpon the croſſe, and there hanging
<pb facs="tcp:227:13"/> was of all men neglected, his louers and friends for feare hyding themſelues, &amp; ſome other of them ſtanding aloofe, wéeping the miſerable daye, and beholding with grieſlye griefe, the moſt pitifull caſe of our deſpiſed Chriſt, no man daring to offer himſelfe for the glory of the father, to honor the bloody body of his dead ſonne. <hi>Then euen then,</hi> dyd this graue Councellour, ritche ſeruant and faythfull Diſciple, caſte of the cowardiſhneſſe of his fleſhe, and armed wyth the ſpirite of God, profeſſed himſelfe alone to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte of Chriſte, in the myddle of his enimies, and at <hi>Pilates</hi> perſon, he ſtowtely (but wiſely and with reuerent duety) beggeth the bodye of his mayſter, not anye longer fearing the loſſe of goods, credite, office, dignitie, or caring for anye perrill that might to his Noble perſon, or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houſe thereafter befall. O Noble chriſtian Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And note well ye Noble ſeruants of Ieſu, the Lorde your mayſter who hath the hartes of Kings in his hands, and doth turne them as he doth the Tydes of the Sea,<note place="margin">Pro. 21.1.</note> and Ryuers of water, did ſo humble the harte of <hi>Pilate</hi> to hys Counſellors requeſt, that ſpéedily he obtayned his godlye deſyre. And that more is, where <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thought hymſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to haue this cauſe in hand, there the Lord of lyfe doth in the moment of tyme, ioyne to him a moſt Noble Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie named <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">God gyueth good ſucceſſe to godly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, farre beyonde all expectation.</note> a teacher of the Law, that ſo both eſtates, Spiritual and Temporall, may perceyue that the Lorde doth keepe them in power and fauour with princes and potentates, bicauſe they ſhoulde with courage doe the Lorde ſeruice: yea, euen in dangerous ſeaſons, if Chriſt be eyther accuſed, pryſoned, or anye waye elſe euill dealt withall. The heroycall hartes then of chriſtian Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and Noble Chriſtians, Courtyers and Gentlemen of credite, ſhould (though alone) make humble and earneſt and eftſoones peticions, to the Deputie of our head Chriſt, for the godly members of the ſame: God will ioyne with them, and enclyne the hartes of the hardned for his ſonnes glory, and graunt ayde vnto you in his buſineſſe beyonde
<pb facs="tcp:227:13"/> your expectation, and your ſelues ſhall finde fauour wyth God, for your labors in his Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his perſon and alſo in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> there are two things to be well and déepely conſidred, for want wherof many doe to their great hindrance from God, take euill example not rightly giuen. Firſt therfore, we are to conſider, what be the thinges in theſe men to be followed of Noble men, women &amp; others. Secondly, the hyndring euill,<note place="margin">A righte eye is to be had in the deeds and lyues of godly men.</note> which manye doe preſumptuouſly take as offered in the perſons of theſe men, to be receyued without reproofe. The thing to bée followed (that ſo this faythfull ſeruice to God may appeare to the more Noble chriſtians) is: that they be endowed with their exampler <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> his ſpiritual quallities and chriſtian habite, which maketh them truely braue and bewtifull: yea, ſo as neyther Silkes, Veluets, Syluer, or Golde can doe, and that is that they be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon honeſt, not giuen to the notable vices, folowing for the moſt parte forreyn Nobilitie, (ſo I call al thoſe by carnall byrth enobled, in whoſe hart God by his ſpirite and worde beareth not the ſoueraigntie) as <hi>Idleneſſe,</hi> the mother of al euill, <hi>ſurfetting, dronkenneſſe, whoredome, chambring, wantonneſſe, blaſphemous othes, filthy and rybaldous talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and couetous cruelty</hi> ouer their ſore oppreſſed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and inferior people, and ſuch lyke: but that they be giuen to the cuſtome of honeſt and chaſt lyfe, ſobrietie of minde and manners, comlyneſſe of apparell, agréeable his dignitie, moderate dyet and frugall hoſpitality, louing harted, and vſing vpright dealing with all men, aſſured that as their perſons doe farre excell the lower ſorte, ſo God requireth more regard of them.<note place="margin">Luc. 12.48</note> 
               <hi>For to whom much is giuen, of him ſhall be much required.</hi> And let them make thys reckning, if they hunte counter herein, the verye heathen Nobilitie ſhall ryſe agaynſt them to iudgement. It is ſayde of the ſeueritie among the olde Romaynes in iudgement, that if an olde perſon or famous Senator (al if greatly for hys deſertes were to be renowmed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="tcp:227:14"/> in any ſorte to be the example of yll to the common weale, he ſhould haue ſeuere cenſure. <hi>Lucius Antonius</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lucius Antonius</note> was caſt out of the Senate houſe, for that hauing maried a Mayde, he caſt her off by deuorce, wythout the counſell of his friends. <hi>Fabritius Lucius Cenſor</hi> adiudged <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Rufinus,</hi>

            <p>The hindering matter, as receyued from Ioſeph and Nicodemus, is after this ſort vſed. Theſe were vertuous noble men, wiſe, and godlye (ſay the <hi>Nicodemitans</hi>

But thys excuſe by Ioſeph and Nicodemus is abſurde, for howe can the children of men, by the ſynnes of the godly, walke the way from ſynne? This can be no other then the pathway to Hell.

               <hi>The hower ſhall come, in the which al that are in their graues, ſhal heare his voyce, and they ſhal come forth that haue done good vnto the Reſurrection of lyfe, but they that haue done euil, vnto the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi> Marke well he ſayth not they whoſe friends haue done well for them, they beyng dead: but he ſayth, they which themſelues haue done good, ſhall go to lyfe.

               <hi>Departe from me yee curſsed into euerlaſting fyre, which is prepared for the Deuil and his Angels, for I was an hungry, &amp; you gaue me no meate, &amp;c.</hi> But percaſe they might aunſwere, our friends gaue penny dole for vs, during the dayes of the worlde.

Séeke therefore by the Goſpell of God, to nouriſhe thy fayth in Chriſt, by whom thou ſhalt be at peace with God, and in a moſt quyet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, thou ſhalt ende a godly lyfe, and make a ioyful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.

            <p>Secondly, we haue ſayde that the ſoule is immortall, and therfore cannot dye. For the holy Scriptures do eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where recorde it. <hi>Thou ſhalt not leaue my ſoule in Hell</hi> (vz in graue ſayth <hi>Dauid) neyther ſhall thy holye one ſee corruption.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.8.</note> As this Scripture ſerueth chiefely to Chriſt, ſo doth it to all other his members.

               <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.</note> And Chriſt Ieſus ſayth in Iohn: <hi>Verily,</hi>

               <hi>verily, I ſay vnto you, he that heareth my worde, and beleeueth in him that ſent me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſoule ſleepeth not with the bodye.</note> 
               <hi>hath eternall lyfe, and he ſhall not come into iudgement, but hath paſſed from death to life.</hi> This place as it moſt plainely prooueth the immortalitie of the ſoule, ſaying: <hi>He hath euerlaſting life, he hath paſſed from death to lyfe</hi> (which cannot be once dreamed to bée ſpoken of the bodye, for that paſſeth from lyfe to naturall death, and to the ſléeping graue.) So doth it refell thoſe Heretiques, which eyther denie the immortalitie of the ſoule, or imagine the ſame to ſleepe tyll the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the body. And to this ende ſerue the words of <hi>Paule. I deſyre to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> But the Storie or Parable of <hi>Diues</hi> &amp; <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> moſt lyuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the one &amp; the other, <hi>Diues</hi> in body is ſumptuouſly buried,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> but his ſoule is preſently in Hell in torments, and beholde he ſléepeth not, for he féeling his terrible payne, is exerciſed in beholding the ioy of his late deſpiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:227:26"/> and calleth for ſuccour, and maketh peticion for his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which yet remayne a lyue, all which approoue the ſoule immortall, and not to ſléepe a ſenceleſſe death wyth the bodye. So the bodye of <hi>Lazarus</hi> caſt in ſome Dytche or open Fielde, his ſoule by the miniſtrie of Angels,<note place="margin">Math. 8.11</note> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp into <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> where he ſléepeth not, but enioyeth the pleaſant comforte of the Heauens. But poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thou wouldſt aſke me then, howe theſe places can ſtande with thoſe which affirme the ſoule to dye, and alſo ſay that the godly after death doe ſléepe? As <hi>that ſoule that ſynneth ſhall dye.</hi> We confeſſe for anſwere, that the ſoule is not altogether immortall, as our God is, and not all ſubiect to death, &amp; we confeſſe that there is a death where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the wicked ſoule ſhall be ouerwhelmed, and ſo is the ſoule (but after a ſpirituall ſorte) both mortall and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. The death of the ſoule, is when his lyfe is not in him:<note place="margin">Mans ſoule mortall and immortall.</note> the lyfe of the ſoule is Chriſt Ieſus, by whoſe ſpirite the godly doe lyue in ſoule a lyfe to eternall lyfe.

For the <hi>wrath of God abydeth vppon him.</hi> Vnderſtande then, that this worde <hi>Death,</hi> is mente not of the ſubſtance of the ſoule, which cannot dye, but of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which ſhall lye in the Lake of fyre and ſhall burne, and lyue for euer, which is called the <hi>Second death.</hi>

Ergo</hi> wythout fayth the ſoule is dead, lyuing in dead workes, and dead ſinnes, as the vnprofitable Wydowes are deade in ſoule, though aliue in body.

<pb facs="tcp:227:27"/> him to ſpeake of the body and not of the ſoule, for as when the ſoule is ioyned with the bodye, he alwayes waketh, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body taketh reſt: So diſioyned, much leſſe he is ſaid to ſléepe. And the body is ſayde to ſléepe, not in reſpect that the ſoule lyeth deade or ſléeping within him (for we haue prooued the ſoule to be with God) but in regarde of his ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe, when the ſoule ſhal returne to his former bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye at the day of iudgement. And by the ſléepe of Death, he awayteth the retyre of his mortall lyfe, by the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of his ſelfe ſoule and bodye ſanctified in Chriſt, the lyfe of the bodye, with whome tyll then, the ſoules of the ſaints raigne vnder the Aulter in heauen, not ſléeping but waking, and crying vpon God. <hi>How long Lorde holy and true, doeſt not thou iudge and auenge the blood of them that dwel on the earth?</hi> Theſe were the ſoules of them ſayth Iohn,<note place="margin">Reue. 6.</note> which lay vnder the Aulter (which is Chriſt) that were <hi>kylled for the worde of God,</hi> and for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie they maintayned.

               <pb facs="tcp:227:27"/> but contrary they affirme there is no payne to them. And <hi>Purgatory</hi> hath the ſame paynes (the Papiſts which fayne that place ſay) that Hell hath: onely this is the difference, that they which be in Purgatory, ſhall come thence, by the merits of the Church and purging in fyre, &amp; in Hell there is no redemption. Wherefore the godly fathers were not in Purgatory paynes, but in the handes of God, which is a Paradiſe of moſt pleaſure. And whereas by the Apoſtle Peter, they go about to proue their Fathers <hi>Lymbo,</hi> as whence the ſoule of Ieſus Chriſt brought them, that place doth neyther affirme the naturall Soule of Chriſt to go to Hell after his death on the croſſe, or elſe that he did bring thence the ſoules of the fathers. For his ſpirite diſcending, left all thoſe there which he found (not in a fayned <hi>Lymbo</hi> but in the paynefull Helles.)

               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.18.19.20.</note> 
               <hi>by the which he alſo wente and preached vnto the ſpirites that are in priſon, which were in tymes paſte diſobedient in the dayes of Noah, &amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ſayth, not that Chriſt in his naturall Soule went downe into Hell, but he ſayth that by that ſpirite which rayſed him to life, he preached to them that are in priſon. Nowe againe, he ſayth not he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out the ſoules of the fathers, which were before hys comming in this priſon, but he ſayth his ſpirite preached vnto them that ſtill are in priſon. So farre from delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are they, that they as obſtinate Rebelles remayne in their former tormentes. Nowe then the reaſon ſtandeth thus. By what ſpirite Chriſt was rayſed from the deade, by that ſame ſpirite he wente, or came to the ſpirites that are in priſon: but Chriſte was rayſed not by his owne ſoule, but by the deuine ſpirite of God (euen by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the father.) Therefore by his deuine power,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17.18.</note> &amp; not in his humaine ſoule, he came vnto the ſpirites that are in priſon.

<pb facs="tcp:227:28"/> This their alledged place (were it the ſoule of Chriſt) yet prooueth not a delyuerye, but a preaching to them, that now was that Sauiour borne, dead and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the redemption of the worlde, which by his ſpirite in the mouth of <hi>Noah</hi> (for one hundred and twenty yeares ſpace) preached to the diſobedient in his dayes, had they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued.

Yea, and alſo to the verye damned in the Hels, (no doubt) at the death of Chriſt, by the deuyne power of his holye ſpirite, was the glory of his croſſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their greater condemnation, which contemned their ſaluation in him, as the godlye fathers and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bodyes in great comforte, by his power were rayſed ſundry from their brethren, to teſtifye the glory of this our crucifyed Chriſt, rayſed vp by his father, and ſet vp wyth him in glory. Adde to this, this place of Peter is ſo farre from warrante to that Popiſhe opinion, that the ſoule of Chriſt, fetched forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules of the godly fathers Adam, &amp;c. That of the flatte contrary he ſayth, they to whome thys ſpirite came, were <hi>diſobedient.</hi> And that thou ſhouldeſt not dreame of Chriſts ſoule after his death herein, he ſetteth thée the time when this office was fulfylled, ſaying: <hi>In the daies of Noah, whyle the Arke was a preparing.</hi> Laſt of all <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the godly learned <hi>Beza,</hi> doth interprete <hi>qui ſunt,</hi> which are, not which were in pryſon, according to the efficacie of the gréeke worde. And the Apoſtles purpoſe, is not to tell vs that they were in priſon, what tyme Chriſte by his ſpirite in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> preached vnto them (for then they were men in naturall lyfe as <hi>Noah</hi> was) but he will giue the Iewes to vnderſtande, that all were drowned except eyght perſons, bicauſe they were diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto his worde.

So now moſt iuſtly they receyue dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which refuſed their ſaluation in Chriſt, preaching vnto them in ſpirite in the mouth of <hi>Noah,</hi> not hauing as yet our nature vpon him.

No maruell therfore though the wryter of the ſacred Storyes ſayth he, call this Image of Samuel, by the name he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, or that the Deuill could tranſfigure himſelfe to the ſhape of a holye man, which hath power alſo to tourne hymſelfe into an Aungell of lyght. But <hi>Turtullian</hi> ſayth. <hi>Abſit vt animam cuiuſlibet ſancti, &amp;c.</hi> God forbid that wée ſhould beléeue the Deuill to haue power to call vp anye ſoule of the ſaints of God, much leſſe of his holy Prophets, for we are taught, that Satan doth tranſforme hymſelfe into an Angel of light, with what eaſe then into the ſhape
<pb facs="tcp:227:30"/> of a manne of lighte, ſo he calleth Samuell, bicauſe he is a member of Chriſt the true light of the worlde, yea he doth ſayth he, affirme himſelfe to be God, and worketh great and prodigious things, if it were poſſibly therby, to ſeduce the elect people of God. That learned father <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſayth, that Samuell apeared not to Saule, but it was an imagined ſhape, which by the deluſion of Satan, was brought vnto Saule, and as we call it a Ghoſt, and he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth probable reaſons to approoue his aſſertion.<note place="margin">Diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell not to appeare to Saule.</note> Firſt ſyth the caſe ſo ſtood with Saule, that God would neyther an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him (being often prouoked) eyther by Oracle, by Prophete, or yet by the Prieſt, it is to be denyed, that he would appeare to him by the deade, eſpecially conſidering hymſelfe in his moſt holy iuſt lawe, to haue forbidden the ſame in theſe words. <hi>Let none be founde among you,</hi>

For all that do ſuch things are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord, &amp; bicauſe of theſe abhominations, the lord doth caſt them out before thee.</hi> Secondly, this muſt be done eyther by the will of God, or by force of Magicall Arte. This was not the will of God, for his written will doth prohibet the ſame, and Satans Arte cannot haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer againſt the will of God. Thirdly, if this <hi>Spectrum</hi> were Samuell, then did he appeare eyther wyllingly, or by force, he coulde not come to Saule wyllingly, for the hartes and obedience of the ſaints of God alyue and dead, doe concurre with the will of him their father. But in this appariſion, the Prophete ſhould haue yéelded to ſathan, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods will, but to ſaye he came againſt his wyll, is more then wicked: nay to ſay he came at al, is peſtiferous, when Abraham affirmeth conſtantly, that neyther Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="tcp:227:31"/> or the place of Torture, can yéelde from them the ſoules of the departed. To conclude, this matter of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, your vnholy lawe of your lyke holye father, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell this opinion, as a fantaſie of no reputation. It was not ſayth this Decrée, Samuel that apeared to Saule, but the Deuill,<note place="margin">Decret. pontif. 26. que. 5. cap.</note> and he ſayth it is an abſurde and vnworthye matter to holde, that ſo holye a manne from his natiuitie, could by Deuilliſh arte be drawne to ſo wicked a man as Saule was. But this was ſayth the Decrée, the fallacies of ſathan, hereby compelling men to dreame, that he had power as well of the holye mens ſoules as of the wicked. Thus by the ſcripture of God, by the teſtimony of godlye Fathers, by probable reaſons, and laſtly (O Papiſt) by the Popes Decrée, thou doeſt ſée howe this was not Samuel, but the deluſion of ſathan, and is called in the ſtorye Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, reſpecting therby the mind of Saule, ſuppoſing this <hi>Spectrum</hi> to be Samuel. And as the golden Mice and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldes,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6.4.5.</note> which the Philiſtines layd in the Arke of wytnes, are called Mice and Emraldes, and yet are but the ſhape and Figures of them, made by the arte of the Philiſtines cunning. Euen ſo the ſhape of Samuell ſet before Saule, by the deceytfull arte of the <hi>Pythoniſſe</hi> (bicauſe he ſtood for Samuel) is ſo called in the holy ſtory. To this I could adde further proofe and authoritie, but I ſuppoſe this ſufficient to a godly minded man, and alſo further teſtimonie of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to deny that any ſoule of man walketh in this world after the hower of death. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> an olde learned and godly Father ſayth,<note place="margin">Atha. li. de queſ. 9. 13.</note> that the wiſdome of God will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſoules to retourne before the iudgement daye into this worlde, leaſt by ſuch meanes the Deuill ſhoulde take vpon him mans ſhape, and ſhould (into the forme of dead men being tranſformed) ſay he were the ſoule of ſuch a one rayſed from death, and by ſuch deceyte, ſhould teach many lyes and falſe opinions, to the deſtruction of the Church. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, that if the ſoules of the dead could walke
<pb facs="tcp:227:31"/> wyth men in earth, his godly mother <hi>Monica,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de cura pro mor. ca. 13 Illirius Cent. 2.</note> who trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Sea to lande to be with him, would neuer nowe after her death be abſent from him. No truely the ſoules of dead men cannot walke in this worlde. For preſently at the hower of death, as the olde Father <hi>Ireneus</hi> alſo ſayth, they are placed, the godly in ioye, the wicked in perpetuall payne. But the Papiſts obiect yet againſt this truth, and ſay, that this Samuel did foretell to Saule, what ſhoulde become of him in that battle, and that he and his children ſhould be ſlayne, and Saule himſelfe ſhoulde be with thys Samuel. Theſe things ſay they, the Deuill could not tell, for the Deuill knoweth not things to come, it muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſitie be the true Prophete Samuel, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lordes Prophete, could therefore foretell of theſe things. But all this is eaſily aunſwered: This obiection ſtandeth vpon trembling props, as thus: The Deuil fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweth not things to come, but this knewe before hand, that Saule ſhoulde in the ouerthrowe be ſlayne, therefore was not this the Deuill, which by the <hi>Pythoniſſe</hi> was rayſed. By the ſame reaſon maye I ſay this was not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell,<note place="margin">Eſa. 41.23.</note> for the holye ſcriptures doe attribute this alone to God, to tell things before they come to paſſe, yet for all that, the ſame place doth nothing derogate, but that the Deuil may foreknow, and alſo declare ſome things, or that they come to light. For ſometyme he receyueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Lord, to plague this Country,<note place="margin">Deuils doe foreknowe many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the rodde of his loue or anger, and ſtanding among the ſaints of god, he heareth the ſentence, which had, ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and eaſily he can vtter, before the execution be done. For the Deuils can moſt ſpéedily as the wynd, ouerrunne the earth, &amp; therfore by <hi>Tertullian</hi> they be called <hi>Volucres.</hi> But hauing authoritie to plague Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 15.16.17.</note> coulde he not haue told Iob, what ſhold haue become of him before he brought the Caldes, the foure wyndes, the fyre, and death to hys children, and ſickneſſe to hymſelfe? yes veryly, ſent to bée
<pb facs="tcp:227:32"/> the lying ſpirite in the mouth of <hi>Achabs</hi> falſe Prophetes, with this warrant,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 22.21.23. &amp;c.</note> that he ſhould preuayle, was it not in his ſkyll to vtter <hi>Achabs</hi> deſtruction, as <hi>Micha</hi> did, before it came to paſſe? yes certainely. But the Lorde will not vſe the perſon of the Deuill to be his Prophet, and therfore his deuyne ſpirite ſpake in the mouth of his holye afflicted ſeruant <hi>Micha.</hi> So no doubt did he know Gods counſel vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered touching Saule, whoſe ende the Lorde had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be at this tyme perfected? and therfore of the <hi>Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſe</hi> demaunded, gyueth anſwere thereby, to bring Saule into greater deſperation, which was Satans glory. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the infernall ſpirites be alſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which name ſome of the olde fathers (as <hi>Tertullian, Lactantius</hi> and others) affirme them to haue <hi>aſciendo,</hi> of knowing much. But doth <hi>Daemon</hi> the Deuill knowe of his owne preſent knowledge things to come? No, for that is proper onely to God, who comprehendeth all tymes, all men, all things, and their whole actions, nowe and to the worldes ende, in his preſent eye and ſkyll. They are to him as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as though they were nowe done before our eyes. All things are open &amp; naked before his Maieſtie.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.2</note> This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Deuill therfore, is of an other inferiour ſorte, and yet not all after one manner. To men in earth is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by ſkyll ſome foreknowledge of things to come. As fyrſt they conſyder the cauſes, and ſo certainly iudge of the effects to followe. Some cauſes neceſſarily drawe their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſome by interception of occurrent matter are cut of, ſo that the effect can in no wiſe followe. The cauſes draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their effects, giue men their warrant to foretell of that to come, whoſe cauſe cannot but bring the ſame. So the experte <hi>Aſtronomian,</hi> by his ſkyll in arte <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> and ſéeing the coniunctions and oppoſitions of the celeſtial partes, can and doe many yeares before, for mo then many after to come, truely and euydently foretell of the Sunne, and ſeuerall Eclypſe is of the Moone, al which in truth and
<pb facs="tcp:227:32"/> déede ſhall follow and come to paſſe. The other are not of lyke certainety, and yet doe men not doubt to iudge by them, for that <hi>the cauſes</hi> contynuing, the effect muſt needes follow, but the cauſe cut off, the effect is taken away. As for example, that man is a contynuall prodigall perſon, a common dronkarde, and a great whoremonger. If theſe cauſes contynue in him, it is of neceſſity, that beggery ſhal be his beſt end. So do the Sea men by the mayden heyres alſo (ſo they call the little diſperpled cloudes, whoſe endes retourne vpwardes, much lyke vnto our Gentles fryſled heades, in theſe monſtruous dayes, a token no doubt of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſtormes to come) preſently déeme of a tempeſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſe. The Phiſition by the prognoſtication of the pulſe, doth foreſée the euente of his pacient in his weakneſſe, and ſuch like. But if this knowledge be graunted to be in wiſe and cunning learned men, much more is it to be graunted to infernall Spirites, which are not dulled by the groſſe humors of mens nature. Adde to this their ancient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in matters, their cauſes and effects done and come to paſſe in the world, ſynce the begynning of the ſame, all which they haue in perfite memorye. And if experience of paſſed things, doe cauſe olde fathers warely to wayte the ſucceſſe of lyke matters to come, &amp; are preferred before the gréene heade for wiſedome: howe ſhall we not be forced to yéelde, as much and more to the Deuill, whoſe dayes are before accountes (and yet not without tyme) and memory paſſing rype? Moreouer, they haue a ſubſtance ſwift as the wynde, and before the Swallow,<note place="margin">Deuilles ſwift as the wynde.</note> can flée the circuite of the earth, and what is done this daye in the extremitie of the Eaſt, can hereby declare it ſpéedily after in the Weaſt. Further, they are placed in the heauenly ayre,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.12</note> as in a moſt high Turret of watch, whence they may beholde the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men a farre of, and declare the ſame inſtantly, as it were by prophecy. And once to make an end hereof: I ſay, they ſée the propheticall ſcriptures, &amp; by their ſkyll in them
<pb facs="tcp:227:33"/> admeaſure the actes of the Church, thorowe which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they become verye rype runners in things to come. Yet notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">The Deuil deceyued.</note> they are often deceyued, and moſte of all deceyue thoſe which reſt vpon their anſwers. For the Lorde doth in his, change the harts, and ſo the actes of men, from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were, by which Satans foreiudgement is preuented, of ſorowful euent to follow: yea, &amp; oft times in the twinckling of an eye, he ſtoppeth the cauſes, &amp; their effectes. As who woulde not haue ſayd when the thrée <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were caſt into the burning ouen,<note place="margin">Dan. 13.</note> that they ſhould haue periſhed by fyer, but euen there and then began firſte the beſt argument of there long lyfe, where and when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, euen the ſonne of God was ſent to ſtop the cauſe and coole the flames, and in the mydſt of them to preſerue his ſeruants, and their clothes from hurte by flame or ſmell of ſmoke. But this could not the Deuill foreſée. Againe, God in his deuine wiſdome doth ſuffer and appoynt the bodies of his ſaintes to be conſumed to aſhes in the fyre, and to death in other extreme perſecutions, ſo as Satan by thys meanes is moſt often blynded, and knoweth not what to ſay. They are deceyued alſo many tymes, partly for that they knowe not the wyll of God, further then it is made knowne to them, partly for that they cannot déepely enter into the harts of men. For that is onely proper to God, to be the <hi>ſercher of the hart and raynes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 17.</note> And many times they doe deceyue by ambition their worſhyppers, in cauſe they would ſeeme ignoraunt in nothing. But to relye vpon our aunſwere to this obiection, that the Deuill cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know.

For if when Satan féedeth their ignorant humors, and with pleaſure draweth them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profeſſion, they neuer therein can finde ſure foote of ſtay, to quyet their minds for ſinne: How ſhall they thereby feele that neceſſary bulwarke, and Ancor of health, at the inſtant of natures farewell, when that ſubtill Serpent doth now no longer dally, but draw them into deſpaire? ſhewing them the multitude of their ſinnes, their ſecuritie in euil, their ignorance in God, their doubt of his fauour (which is an <gap reason="foreign">

But then doth Satan ſharply fight againſt the wounded conſcience, and openeth the truth, as thereby further to pierce his conſcience to death, and enforcing to his harte, theſe things cannot helpe thée, thy truſt is vaine in them. Againſt which temptation, what helpe in Popery? They are fayne to cry, this is thy helpe euen Ieſus Chriſt, but then his comfort is cut ſhort, in that they pull his meditation from the Lorde crucifyed, and lay on bed before him a braſen Crucifixe. They tell him that his friends ſhall praye for him, and the Church ſhal be plyed with Trentals, to delyuer him from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which doctrine is moſt troubleſome, and ſo the poore Papiſt, for all that Popery can doe, dyeth thereby moſte doubtfull of reſt, if not moſt fearefull of eternall payne. Conſyder this well, there is not the beſt treaſure in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that doth warrante thée peace in death.

            <p>The ſecond note is, that the godly are ſo farre from fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring naturall death, that on the contrary part, they humbly many tymes at the hande of God, can earneſtly pray for it, and wyſhe it: yea, and eaten vp of griefe for the dayes of ſynne, they lament that they are not diſburdened of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye thereof. Finally, in deſyre of the full accompliſhment of the bodye of Chriſt, that the ſame his Church might be
<pb facs="tcp:227:38"/> thorowly glorifyed, in heauen (as ſhe is in parte) and in earth perfitly ſanctifyed. The ſaints in this lyfe, praye for the diſſolution of the world, and Chriſt to come with ſpeede to iudgement. For the fyrſt Paule prayeth thus: <hi>I deſyre to be diſſolued and to be with Chriſt,</hi> and our <hi>Symeon</hi> here. <hi>Lorde now let thy ſeruaunt depart in peace.</hi> Secondly, in the ſeuenth to the Romaynes, Paule cryeth out of ſynne, lamenting and ſaying: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall delyuer me from the body of this death,</hi> that is, from this lumpe of fleſhly ſinne and death. Where note (gentle Chriſtian) that the ſaintes of God are ſubiect to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſinne, but ſo as with griefe and anguiſhe of heart, they carry that lumpe of death. Yet they in pacient morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by his holy ſpirite, wayte his tyme ſet for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuerie, and earneſtly deſyre the ſame. Note alſo the right ende of this peticion, which by the wicked and deſperate is abuſed:<note place="margin">A due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the deſyre of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death.</note> The godleſſe cumbred with piercing ſting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, aſhamed of their ſtate, and looking for his heauye iudgement, doe alſo deſyre and cry for death. So doe the poore ignorante perſons, which in pryſon, in Gallyes, or Iayles, and pyning in payne. The poore oppreſſed: the née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which cannot haue to ſatiſfie the hungry, &amp; crye of their children, and ſelues: the ſick pacient, which long hath lyen of an incurable diſeaſe. Theſe and ſuch lyke deſyre death, but it is not to the right ende, for which it ſhould be deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. They only haue reſpect to the preſent paine or ſhame, and to fyniſh that, they do not onely deſyre, but the wicked deſperate perſons, in deſpite of God his holy lawe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of Nature, doe with the pernicious knyfe of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall paine, bereaue for a tyme, the ſorrowes of thys ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corps. But ſuch deſperate death, is the purchaſe of Hel with <hi>Iudas, Achitophel,</hi> king <hi>Saule,</hi> and ſuch others. Now the true and lyuely ende of this peticion in the elect of God is. That leaſt they ſhould by to much acquaintance wyth finne and death, become reſty in the bed of hir delight, and

Yet ſo as I ſaye, ſtill they doe by fayth in hope ſuppreſſe the dolorous griefe of ſinne in lyfe, with the continual meditation of the inwarde ioyes receyued by grace in Chriſt, and therein ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themſelues, as with the earneſt penny of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers poſſeſſion, which they are aſſured of, when the Lord in mercy ſhall call them to himſelfe by death.

            </p>
            <p>And thirdly, the loue and longing deſyre, which in the ſaintes is apparant, for the whole and perfite ioye of the Church, the Apoſtle S. Iohn manifeſteth in theſe wordes: <hi>O Lorde come quickly,</hi>

            <p>Laſt of all, when <hi>Symeon</hi> ſayth: <hi>Lord now let thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt departe in peace,</hi> he doth teach vs to abhorre all troubleſome and murtherous kinde of death. And doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the Apoſtles doe arme vs to pacience, and vnto forbearing of tyranny, with long ſuffering, as well by their owne example, as doctrine. But in no waies haue they eyther ſlayne themſelues, to be ridde of priſons, Irons, cruell murther or tyranny, but haue ſought by all meanes rather to maintayne their lyfe, to doe more good therein to the Church of God, then to haſten their ende by violent ſtroke. For thys cauſe did <hi>Paule</hi> exhorte <hi>Timothie</hi> to pacience, willing him to <hi>ſuffer aduerſity, to do the worke of an Euangeliſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>and to make his miniſtery knowne.</hi> He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him that he is now ready to be offred to dye for Chriſt, but he feareth it not, or will preuente <hi>Nero</hi> his cruelty, by his owne hande, but will lyue till the daye of his diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Lorde hath ſet for him, reioycing in that ſuch tyranny ſhall ſpéede him to that crowne, which is layde vp for him at the ende of his lawful fight,<note place="margin">2.

And when the Iaylor at <hi>Philippos,</hi> awaking oute of ſléepe, ſaw the priſon dores open (wherin <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were faſt in the inner priſon chayned, and ſtraightly committed to his charge) drew his ſworde,<note place="margin">Act. 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

By which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, both the Iaylors lyfe was ſaued, Satan baniſhed, the Iaylor and his houſhold baptized, &amp; the Apoſtles the nexte day deliuered.

Sée then by how great a miracle, God doth commaund to ſubiect our ſelues to the yoke of great tyranny to conſerue lyfe.

So (ſayth <hi>Martyr</hi>) Sampſon did not raſhly caſt himſelfe to death, but faythfully follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his vocation, lyke as the hartie Souldiour, albeit the Coward ſay vnto him beware, go not, there are arrowes, Speares, Gunnes, and ſhot innumerable, wherewith yée ſhall periſhe. They anſwere, what if? We go not to ſéeke death, we go to defend our Countrie and goods, and to bée reuenged of our enimies, to followe our calling: Euen ſo (ſayth he) did Sampſon, and was thereto ledde by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, that Sampſon herein was the Image of Chriſt, who as he lyued, he much vexed &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Deuill, ſo by his death he tryumphed againſt him. The Philiſtines he compareth with the Iewes, &amp; Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with Chriſt as a figure of him. The Philiſtines in the victory againſt Sampſon, receyued their vtter ruine and decay. And the Iewes crucifying Chriſt, caſt themſelues into eternall damnation. The ende (ſayth <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>) in nature was both one, but in condition ſundry, twixte the Philiſtines and Sampſon. In nature they both dyed, but in condition, the Philiſtines in ſurfetting, cruelty, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry are deſtroyed. And Sampſon endeth his naturall lyfe in repentance, in fayth and in prayer to God. Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had fallen in déede ſayth he, but he is turned vnto God, he calleth vpon him &amp; was heard. As for theſe his wordes: <hi>Let me looſe my lyfe with the Philiſtines,</hi> he ſpake them not of deſpaire, but he hereby humbled himſelfe before God, for that he had ſo greatly neglected his function and calling, beſéeching God hereby to be aduenged of the Philiſtines, who had put out the eyes of Gods magiſtrate, not bicauſe
<pb facs="tcp:227:43"/> they would this way puniſh his treſpaſſe, but this they did in deſpite of Iſraell, and that he ſhould no more be able to doe them violence. And iuſtly (ſayth mayſter <hi>Bucer</hi>) dyd he ſorrow for the loſſe of his eyes:<note place="margin">Bucer. in Iudic. cap. 16.30.</note> For in that he bare the perſon of the Lordes magiſtrate, the iniury done to hym was to the great loſſe and domage of the Iewes common weale. In this that he deſyreth to dye (ſayth he) he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hys earneſt, and that godly and good deuotion &amp; zeale, to the people of Iſrael, and to the glorye of God. For the Lorde would not that he ſhould lyue any longer, therefore he rightly deſyreth death. And bicauſe he was now ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of the Philiſtines, and with him the whole people of God, and God himſelf alſo, ſo as theſe enimies began to inſult againſt God in great pryde, he did alſo right &amp; iuſtly aſke that the Lord would take vengeance on them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord <hi>Iehoua</hi> heard his prayer, fauoured his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and gaue him good ſucceſſe. By this we gather ſayth <hi>Bucer,</hi> his death to be acceptable and approoued with God,<note place="margin">Sampſons death, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</note> otherwiſe his holyneſſe woulde not haue giuen Sampſon ſuch ſucceſſe. And by this we ſée ſayth he, that not euerye one which caſte themſelues to extreme death, for the good of the people, are to be condemned, but ſuch onely as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant from God, doe murther themſelues. It was Sampſons office, to ſaue and delyuer his charge Iſraell, from the tyrannous opreſſion of the Philiſtines, and ſythe he could not by any poſſibilitie elſe do it, this way he right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fyniſhed his function. So did Chriſt ſayth <hi>Bucer,</hi> offer himſelfe to hys enimies, from whom he might haue béene delyuered. Where againe, Sampſon is by the ſpirite of God with Ionas, apoynted to be the figure of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Sampſon a Figure of our ſauiour Chriſt.</note> And in ſundry poynts <hi>Bucer</hi> ſetteth downe this figure, as hée repreſented Chriſt, chiefly in that he was the delyuerer of Iſrael: So in theſe things alſo he became a lyuely Image of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt noble <hi>Moſsiah.</hi> His conception was by the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to his mother <hi>Manoah,</hi> with a ſpeciall declaration
<pb facs="tcp:227:44"/> foretolde. So was Chriſt to Mary, by the Angell <hi>Gabriel.</hi> The mother was barren, and brought forth no children: So was the Virgin not bearing, tyll ſhe brought forth the Lorde Ieſus. All hys lyfe he was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> that is ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the worlde, and dedicate to God. So was Chriſt Ieſus. The ſpirite of God wrought wonderfully in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous things with him. And that he imbraced ſtraunge perſons, which in déede was ſinne in the figure Sampſon, yet therein doth he not moſt vnſéemely figure and ſhadow Chriſts receyte of the Gentyls. Alſo that he ſuppreſſed the enemies of God, and by a ſecrete and vnknowne waye, and by his owne hand, and in his death ouerthrew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers. Herein he was a moſt lyuely ſhadowe of oure Chriſt, who by hys death brought true Iſraelits lyfe, and wherin the Iewes thought to haue the victorie, as in <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the heyre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21 38</note> therein they loſt the inheritance, and were caſt into vtter deſtruction, &amp;c. Further, he did rather begin, then make perfite the delyuery of Gods people from their foes: Euen ſo our ſauiour Chriſt did dayly more and more after his death, then before, worke the redemption of hys chyldren by the knowledge of the Goſpell, from the hands of Satan, and ſhal perfite the ſame in the day of our reſurrection. Agayne, Sampſon more vexed his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by his death, then he did during his fight with them in lyfe:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.64.65.66</note> So were the Phariſeys and Iewes more troubled, Chriſt lying in his graue, then they were when he in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching euerye where wrought their confuſion, wherefore they ſpared no payne to ſeale and ſet watch about the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher: Laſt of all, Sampſon did ſo enter into the delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iſraell, that by this begynning, his ſucceſſors myght with more encreaſe profyte the ſame: So our ſauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu begynning to preache the Goſpell, and hauing in hys death wholy deſtroyed the power of Satan, gaue bleſſing vnto his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and ſo to his Church, to enlarge the borders of his ſpirituall body, more then in his
<pb facs="tcp:227:44"/> owne perſon, himſelfe brought to paſſe. Thus you ſée how Sampſons lyfe and death is ſanctifyed, being the ſhadowe of Chriſt, and deliuered from the ignomy of ſelfe ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Of that laſt example of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who wyſhed the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to caſt him into the Sea,<note place="margin">Ionas. 1.2.</note> the ſtorye reporteth it Gods action. Firſt by caſting of lottes, then by ſtaying the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and thirdly, in that the Lorde had prepared a great Fiſhe to ſwallowe vp <hi>Ionas,</hi> but chiefely the tyme of hys buryall in the belly of the Fiſhe, which (the text ſayth) was thrée dayes and thrée nightes. And this man, this Prophet, and this his burial, doth Chriſt alowe for his ymage of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in the heart of the earth, ſaying: <hi>As Ionas was in the Whales belly three dayes and three nights,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 12.40.</note> 
               <hi>ſo ſhall the ſonne of man be three dayes and three nightes, in the harte of the earth.</hi> This acte as it is here alowed of Chriſt for a figure of his buriall and death: So <hi>Ionas</hi> being the Lordes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, knew from his God, that this way he ſhould appeaſe the ſea and tempeſt, and therfore ſubmitted himſelfe to the ordinance of his good God. Now vpon this place in <hi>Ionas, Hierome</hi> holdeth that we ought not to caſt our ſelues into death, but ſtowtely to withſtande, except (ſayth he) it be to conſerue chaſtitie. Where it ſéemeth, he would for chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake permit a man or woman to kyll themſelues.<note place="margin">Euſe. lib. 8 cap. 17. fol. 197.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Ambroſe</hi> leaneth on that ſide alſo. And <hi>Euſebius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſariences</hi> telleth vs of a modeſt Matrone, called <hi>Sophronia,</hi> the Gouernours wyfe of Rome, whoſe bewtie bereaued <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyran of his modeſty: whereas he ſhould haue defended mariage, he moſt wickedly ſought to defyle the ſame, and ſent ſuch letcherous Courtiers, as he himſelf was, to fetch to his luſt this bewtifull Dame: <hi>Sophronia</hi> told her huſband, who after heauy pauſe cryed: And what ſhall we doe? To thys Tyran eyther we muſt yéelde, or elſe we muſt loſe our lyues. But when ſhe perceyued her huſband for feare of death, woulde delyuer her to the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous bedde, ſhe ſubtilly ſaide to the Baudes which were
<pb facs="tcp:227:45"/> ſent, ſtay in a little vntill I dreſſe me comely, for ſo Noble a man as <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Emperour, and I will go wyth you, ſhe entreth her chamber, ſhe prayeth to God, &amp; wyth a ſworde ſhe kylleth her ſelf, ſo kéeping her chaſte promiſe to her chriſtian huſband. The godly father <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtay at this, but in the ende he ſayth: the Law of God is moſt worthy and ſure, which ſayth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> And we are rather to commende the godlye policie &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian acte,<note place="margin">The ſtorye of godlye Dorothea.</note> of the other chriſtian Virgin <hi>Dorothea</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the ſame chapter, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſts cauſe led to death in this <hi>Maxentius</hi> tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, was by his fylthie meſſengers aſſaulted to breake her Virginitie with the letcherous Lorde and Prince <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> But thys golden aunſwere ſhe gaue him. It were a moſt wicked thing (ſayth ſhe) to take this temple of God, my body once dedicated to his honor, &amp; to caſt it nowe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Idolatry or fleſhly luſts. Secondly, I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death for my Lorde Chriſt and louing huſbande, by your mayſters ſentence, and am preparing my ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. What? ſhould I now yeelde to wickedneſſe and luſte? But this is farre vnſytting your Lords eſtate, to alure me (a poore condemned priſoner) to ſo laſciuious lyfe, and by fugred words from tyrannous harte, to counterfeyte ſuche fayre promiſes. And if I could be thus bewitched to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet howe coulde I be perſwaded of the ſoftneſſe of <hi>Maxentius</hi> harte, that cannot be mollified in the flowing Ryuers of our chriſtian blood, which euery daye he ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly ſheddeth. But now this Tyran was more ſet on fyre by theſe godly denials, and would haue forced her, had not ſhe wiſely for the tyme perſwaded him, from whoſe face (as by intermiſſion for a tyme eſcaped) ſhe priuily fledde, forſaking her houſe, her riches, and all ſhe had, and that in the night tyme, with her chaſt body, from the face of ſo fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie a Prince, and corrupted Courte. This Matrone had both regarde to her religion (and therefore would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:227:45"/> againſt it, which ſayth: <hi>Thou ſhalt not kyll</hi>) and to her chaſt conuerſation alſo, which cauſed her to flie from that ſatanicall ſynke of <hi>Venus</hi> Court. And for the Romiſh Matrone I ſay, her harte God might enclyne to him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the twinckling of her death, &amp; ſo in her Chriſt vouchſafe her pardon: But I cannot ſée her acte to bée ſoundly warranted, when as we may not <hi>doe an euill, that good may come thereof.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.8. Deut. 23.25.</note> But ſurely the violent force to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterous acte, is both by the lawe of God and man, layde vpon the oppreſſor onely, and the oppreſſed is ſet frée. If a man fynde a betrothed mayde in the Féelde, and force her,<note place="margin">In forced extremitie, the compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in thys ſyn guylt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</note> and lye with her, then the man that lay with her ſhall <hi>dye alone,</hi> and vnto the mayde thou ſhalt doe nothing, bicauſe there is no cauſe of death in her. For as when a man ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth againſt his neighbour (ſayth the Lord) and woundeth him to death, ſo is this matter. Againe, ſhe cryed, and there was none to ſuccour her. Loe, the violator of virginity ſhal dye, and the deflowred being hereto forced, ſhewing her whole and contynuall power to the contrary, ſhe is by the lawe of God adiudged innocent. Here is then the lawfull remedy againſt rape and pollucion. Not with <hi>Lucrece</hi> to yéelde and then to kyll, or with chriſtian <hi>Sophronia,</hi> to fall into an extreme miſerie, to auoyde a peſtilente miſchiefe, but with beſt aduiſed <hi>Dorothe</hi> to flée, and if you cannot, with chaſte <hi>Suſanna</hi> to fall into the hands of Gods directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to vſe all power ye may to kéepe your bodyes impollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But in no wiſe kyll your ſelues, for that is repugnant to the law and will of God, which kynde of death, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer your good intentes bee, God hath promiſed to reuenge vpon the impenitent. And to conclude this matter (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for the dangerous ſubtyltie of flattering temptation) I haue ſayde ſomewhat the more. I ſay as Father <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ſayde: If we ſhal to auoyde ſinne in vs, déeme it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to kyll our ſelues, we ſhoulde not ſuffer our bodyes to lyue one little whyle after baptiſme. For what is he that
<pb facs="tcp:227:46"/> lyueth and ſynneth not?<note place="margin">Not lawful to kyll our ſelues, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſhun ſynne.</note> But he that kylleth himſelfe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with bloudy hande (that is without lawful authority from his God and Magiſtrate) let him heare what the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye ſayth thereto. <hi>Surely I will require your bloude wherein your lyues are, at the hande of euery beaſt will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, and at the hand of man, euen at the hande of a mans brother will I require the lyfe of man,</hi> that is to ſay, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be that taketh the lyfe from man, whether it bée your ſelues that kyll your owne lyfe: whether it be a beaſt that flayeth you, or if it be thy owne brother that murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee, thy ſelfe, that beaſt, this thy brother ſhal anſwere his bloud for thine. Looke for this ye tyrannous opreſſors, ye Popiſh murtherers, &amp; beaſtly butchers of Gods ſaints, ye blinde guydes and dombe Dogs, ye ydle ſhepeards, ye obſtinate heretikes, ye théeues and murtherers for mens purſes, ye brawlers and fyghters, and you that kyll your ſelues tremble and feare. So then we maye not for anye cauſe, by how much ſoeuer we ſhould ſeeme to praiſe God, or to auoyde daunger of the heathen, or yet to kéepe oure bodies chaſte from ſinfull bedde, by anye meanes laye vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente hands vpon our ſelues, thereby to bereaue our lyfe, for that act is damnable. We are to <hi>hate &amp; flee from ſyn as from a Serpent,</hi> and to deſyre the Lorde to ende the dayes therof,<note place="margin">Eccle. 21.2</note> and to delyuer vs from that euil Satan and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of iniquitie, yea and that by death, but yet ſo that the ſame may be to vs in peace, eſtranged from al violence in our ſelues, and alwayes according to his worde. To thys our holy <hi>Symeon</hi> giueth vs inſtruction, to whoſe ſuccéeding words, we will giue eare, which giue to vs the cauſe of his peticion thus.</p>
            <q>For mine eyes haue ſeene thy Saluation.</q>
            <p>During the dayes of Iſraels miſerie, <hi>Symeon</hi> euer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped after releaſe, whereby he teacheth vs, how plunged in Popery, we ſhould expect the returne of Gods holy goſpel, whereof we haue in our childrens daies, had eftſoones the
<pb facs="tcp:227:46"/> experience. God make bs thankfull therefore. And this is natural that after Winter commeth Sommer, after ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my tempeſt, ſerenious ſeaſon, and after the darkneſſe of the night, the bright ſhyning day. So is it alſo the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all courſe of God in his Chriſt, from time to time, as the teſtimony therof in the ſcriptures is moſt apparante. We now are with ioye of heart to imbrace the <hi>Halcion</hi> dayes, our Sommers warmth, this quyet raigne, the ſhyning countenance of Gods good fauour to vs, mauger the malice of all Romaniſts at home and abroad, and with effect (but not in vayne) to receyue the light of the goſpell, yet plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully caſting his bleſſed beames, leaſt we haue greater cauſe to ſaye, when we ſee darkneſſe againe to ſhadow the ſunne beames of righteouſneſſe. Lord that we were with <hi>Symeon</hi> dead in peace, from the miſerable deaths we are lyke to féele, in the ſworde of thy wrath. And nowe ſayth <hi>Symeon,</hi> that as well my bodily eyes, as the inward of my ſoule, haue ſéene thy ſauing health: Nowe Lorde for thys cauſe ſhall I dye moſt wyllingly. But if ſo the naturall ſight of Chriſt, as yet an infante, and ſubiect to infyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whoſe glorie yet was holden in the bodye of the little Babe, wrought ſuch and ſo great ioy in heart, &amp; aſſurance in death to this good <hi>Symeon,</hi> how muche more ought the ſame Chriſt to worke in vs quietneſſe of conſcience, nowe that he is glorifyed, and the fulneſſe of our lyfe perfited in him?<note place="margin">2.

By his holy goſpell he ſheweth himſelfe face to face, and not by the infyrmitie of his fleſh, but by the deuine power of his holy ſpirite he teacheth vs, purgeth vs, and pardoneth our ſinnes, and changeth vs to a lyfe moſt méete for his holy preſence. And to be ſhort, he is ſo abſent from vs in body, that we maye with boldneſſe

Loe this is that chriſtian ſight and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preſence that we haue of our Chriſt. And if this cannot worke in vs a wyllingneſſe to dye with ioye (bicauſe oure ſynnes by Chriſtes death purged) we ſhal raigne with him eternally, then are we a thouſand tymes more harde then the Adamant, blinder then the Moules, and more vnkinde then the vnnaturall Iewes, it is verye ſignificante that <hi>Symeon</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">No man ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but by hys owne fayth.</note> Becauſe <hi>mine eyes hath ſeene, &amp;c.</hi> In which wordes are layde vp this <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> that not other mens fayth could worke this comfort in this good father, excepte together his owne eyes in fayth, had ſéene this Babe to be hys ſauiour,<note place="margin">Abac. 2.4 Gal. 3.11.

The righteouſneſſe of the righteous ſhal be vpon him, and the wickedneſſe of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall be vpon himſelfe.</hi> To this end ſerueth that whole excellent Chapter, to the reading whereof I referre thée. The prayers of the faythfull doe much preuayle to thoſe, that yet are not fully brought to Chriſt. Yea, &amp; the ardent zeale of others fayth, doth enflame the ſoules of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to follow their ſteps in Chriſt, and the prayer of one faythful man, doth promiſe auayle to another, for encreaſe in fayth.<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.18 19.

<pb facs="tcp:227:48"/> fayth be ſaued, as we haue ſufficiently prooued, wherefore <hi>Symeon</hi> rightly reioyceth, that his proper eyes, to ſaye the eyes of his fayth, and alſo of bodye, haue had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented perſwaſion in his heart, that this borne Babe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Virgins ſon, is his ſauiour. But let no man dreame here, that <hi>Symeons ſolace</hi> is of that, that only he ſaw with his bodily eyes, the body of Chriſt. For notwithſtanding that ſight, had he not with the eyes of his fayth beholden Chriſt for his onely Sauiour, he had died moſt ſorrowfull. What did it profite the Phariſeys, Iewes, Pilate, Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, and the tormentors of Chriſt, that they ſawe hym whom they pierced? No more then it doth the Traytor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſentence of death pronounced againſt him, to loke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the Iudge, haſting the expectation of his final decrée. Such is the comforte to all thoſe Papiſtes, which dreame and deceyue the worlde, in this imagination, that Chriſts body is to our ſight offred really, corporally, fleſhe, bloud, and bone, as he was borne of the Virgin Mary, in the ſacryfice of their dead Maſſe.<note place="margin">A reproofe to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe Maſſe</note> For as the Iewes were condemned for this ſight, bicauſe then when they ſo ſawe him, they crucifyed him: So are they Papiſtes, when as with the Iewes, the Popiſhe Prieſt, if he coulde ſhewe thée in déede, the bodye of his Chriſt in his abhominable Maſſe, doth in ſacryficing Chriſt euery daye, ſo often cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him afreſhe. For ſayth the Hebrewes, where ſo euer Chriſt is offred, there he is alſo deade, that is to ſay, againe crucified.

For no more may Chriſt be offered bloudy. But I aſke the ſhauen Gentleman, whether he offer truely the bodye of Chriſt or no? If he ſay he doth, then I aſke hym whether the ſame body that roſe from death, and was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfied? To this if he ſay yea: then agayne I ſay, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that body is offred, he muſt of force in bloud be offred, forſomuch as he hath revnited the ſame to his ſoule, and Godhead, and is not a ſpirite without fleſhe and bloud, as he ſayth to Thomas.<note place="margin">Lu. 24.39.</note> Secondly, if you could and doe offer his body without bloud,<note place="margin">An vnblou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſacryfice can neuer take awaye ſinne.</note> you muſt of force new agayne kill him, and tread a freſhe that glorious Wyne preſſe, which ye denie to doe. Thirdly, if your ſacrifice be an vnbloudye Sacrifice, then cannot it obtayne forgiueneſſe of ſinnes (which is the colour ye haue to offer it, but your owne lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring luſte is the cauſe of it) For the Apoſtle ſayth, that without blood,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22</note> 
               <hi>there is no forgiueneſſe.</hi> And without a teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is no promiſe, &amp; wherſoeuer this Teſtamente and bodye is offred, there of neceſſitie muſt be the death of the Teſtator.

For thus ſayth the text. <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt be the death of him that made the Teſtament.</hi> And if you wil reply that Chriſt is aliue, and you kill him not which cannot die, and yet ye offer him, I ſaye firſt, that in the ſacrifice of
<pb facs="tcp:227:49"/> Chriſtes Teſtament, vnleſſe he dye, the Teſtament is of no force, ſo long as he liueth that made it. And then I ſaye it is moſt abſurde, to ſay that you can offer Chriſt, and not make him to ſuffer death againe. When as the text ſayth: <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places,</hi>

And forget not that he ſayth, Chriſt is not gone to heauen, to the ende he ſhould be often offered, where the daylie offering of the Popiſhe Maſſe is denied by Paule, to be the offering of Chriſt, and that, that Oblation is againſt the will of God, who hath aſcended the heauens, bicauſe he will no more be offered (for he can no more be ſlaine) and for that he hath obtained, in that his owne ſacryfice already for vs <hi>eternall redemption.</hi> And laſte of all he ſayth, that whenſoeuer Chriſt is offred, he is therewith ſlayne.

As he is God (ſayth he a little after) he is euerye where, but as he is man, he is onely in heauen, yet for the coniunction of the two natures in Chriſt, ſundry tymes in Scripture, that is ſpoken of the one, which is proper to the other: As in example: <hi>No man aſcendeth into heauen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.1.9</note> 
               <hi>but the ſame which came from heauen, euen the ſonne of man which is in heauen.</hi> And yet was not Chriſt aſcended, but in earth: not glorifyed, but ſubiect to death: But bicauſe of the coniunction with the deuyne nature, that is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the humayne nature in ſpéeche, which in déede and truth was onely performed in his Deitie. Agayne,<note place="margin">Act. 20.2</note> 
               <hi>ye are bought with the bloud of God.</hi> Who knoweth not that this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was performed in the humane nature of Chriſt? But bicauſe he is very God, and the nature of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo connexed, that it is inſeperable, therfore this <hi>Conio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and participation of the two natures is often vſed. And for thys cauſe we ſay God is borne, deade and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for vs, when the humane nature onely was ſo. But perhaps it maye aſtonie thée, when I ſay that the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt be inſeperable, and yet the Godhead is in
<pb facs="tcp:227:55"/> many places. Where his humanity is not, nay his deuine nature in all places, and his humane nature onely in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But conſyder in thy ſelf a perfite mirror and ymage hereof. Thy ſoule and body are of two natures, the one a ſpirite, the other a compact forme of fleſhe, the one mortal, the other cannot dye. Yet during lyfe they are inſeperably knit both natures in one, &amp; in ſuch ſorte, as eyther nature notwithſtanding, do kéepe their ſundry condition. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye ſléepeth, but the ſoule is alwayes waking: the body ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and drinketh naturall meates, the ſoule onely féedeth of the worde of God: the body is ſicke and dyeth, the ſoule is for the moſt parte beſt healthy, when the body is neareſt death, and moſt lyuely when ſhe is diſcharged of the bodye of ſynne by death: Agayne, the ſoule reſting with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is alſo the ſelfe inſtant by her powers, at the vtmoſte partes of the worlde, and aboue the clowds, whether ſhée hath daylie acceſſe by fayth and inuocation, yet for al this, the body is but in one place: So is it in Chriſt. <hi>He is riſen, he is not here,</hi>

               <hi>king of the moſt high God, &amp;c.

He is without father in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, onely being conceyued by the holye ghoſt, of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſéede: wythout mother in his deuyne nature, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the fathers owne nature, without beginning of dayes or ende of lyfe. For he is God for euer. And though in his humanitie he ſuffred for vs, yet his Godhead coulde not dye, but remayneth immortall for euer. This Ieſus is both king and prieſt, not after <hi>Aaron,</hi> but according to <hi>Melchiſedeches order,</hi> for all tymes to come.

<pb facs="tcp:227:58"/> there can beſides hym be none other, who gaue hymſelfe to dye for vs, and by whoſe onely death, we be all ſaued that beléeue in hym.</p>

               <hi>we haue an Aduocate with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the reconciliation for our ſinnes, and not for our ſinnes only, but for the ſynnes of the whole worlde.</hi> Where note that the Apoſtle ſayth, and <hi>for this cauſe is he the Mediator of the new Teſtament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 9.15.</note> Namely for thys cauſe, that through his death, men might receyue the promiſe of inheritance. He that dyeth for mans tranſgreſſions, is onely the Mediator for their ſinnes. But Chriſt only dyeth for mans tranſgreſſions, therfore Chriſt is the onely Mediator for mans iniquitie. This is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon. And further, this prieſthood ſo dwelleth ſtill in Chriſt, that no inferiour creature maye be enſtalled into
<pb facs="tcp:227:59"/> that function. For he lyueth for euer, and therfore contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a prieſt for euer, <hi>after the order of Melcheſedech.</hi>

            <p>Wherſoeuer then any man or Angell, would take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym this office, to be a prieſt to offer ſacrifice in the Church of God. For thy ſynnes know thou that he is not thy <gap reason="foreign">

Theſe therefore can be no lawfull prieſts to offer for ſinne, were there any ſuch ſacrifyce to be offered. The lawe of Moſes made ſuch men prieſts, as were ſubiect to death. The Popiſhe lawe anoyleth ſuch as are wrapped in infyrmities: but the law of the othe of God (which is the goſpell) maketh the ſonne of God Chriſt Ieſus, onely the ſacryfycing prieſt of hys Churche, who is without ſynne, deuoyde of infyrmitie, holy, harmeleſſe, vndefyled, higher then the heauens, ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſynners, once for all offred, a full price in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce to his father vpon the croſſe, for the ſyns of the whole

            <p>Nowe we haue to conſyder alſo, from what it is that thys Sauyour Chriſt delyuereth vs. Truely from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath, from the chaynes of ſynne, and her rewarde, which is <hi>eternall death.</hi> Of which deliuerance <hi>Zacharius</hi> ſpeaketh in his Song,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23 Luc. 1.74.</note> 
               <hi>that wee being delyuered from the feare of our enimies, might ſerue him without feare, &amp;c.</hi> But when it is ſayde he delyuereth vs, it is imported we are fyrſt in thraldome,<note place="margin">Mans ſtate wythout Chriſt, thral<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome and moſt miſery.</note> and bounde from libertie: Euen ſo are the ſonnes of men by nature thralled vnto the wrath of God, bound in chaynes of ſynne, and ſubiect to the curſſe of euerlaſting death. Therin borne, in it lyuing and luſting death by the contynuall deſyres therof.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.3.</note> But <hi>Synne, ſynne,</hi> is the cauſe that Gods iuſtice cannot but giue vs wrath, and his wrath cannot (procéeding from his iuſtice) but caſt the ſynner into the priſon of eternal payne, where is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſorrowe, wéeping, torments, and gnaſhing of téeth, the worme that dyeth not, and the anger of God. And this ſynne is, and maye be ſayde to be of two kyndes, the one procéeding from the other. <hi>Originall</hi> and <hi>Actuall. Originall</hi> commeth wyth the lumpe of maſſy poyſoned fleſhe,<note place="margin">Originall ſynne and actuall.</note> which our parentage hath brought to vs, from the loynes of oure fyrſt father Adam. And he becommeth ſynful by the breach of Gods holye lawe in Paradiſe, hath begotten by ſynfull ſéede, his children in ſynne, who by ſucceſſion haue encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the worlde to thys daye from his ſynfull loynes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get vs ſynfull creatures, of our ſynfull mothers. And thus are we guyltie of Adams ſynne, called Originall, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſynne. For lyke as out of a poyſoned Veſſell can be drawne no other lycour but poyſoned. So from the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned ſéede of Adam, can procéede no other then lyke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted matter, for mans propagation and ofſpring. And againe thys worde ſynne, ſignifyeth generally the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb facs="tcp:227:60"/> to God, the offending of God by the breaking of hys moſt holy commaundements. This difference is betwéene Originall and Actuall ſynne, the one we bring with vs in fleſh, as guyltie by byrth of our fathers tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>By Adam all men do dye.</hi> The other is, that our ſelues in mynde and bodye doe commit daylie agaynſt our God and his holy lawe, which we do eyther in mynde,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.22.</note> in will, in harte and affection, in tong or hande, in ſoule or bodye, in one or both. The fyrſt doth infecte all other that come from his fyrſt roote. For lyke as leporous parents of their bodyes cannot but beget, and the chyldren which are borne of them, are defyled, as wel with the parents lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as contaminate with their owne naturall corruption: Euen ſo are the poſteritie of Adam infected with the fyrſt fathers leproſie in ſynne, and ſteyned with their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall offences and iniquitie, which one lamenting ſayeth: And great is that Original ſynne,<note place="margin">Barnardus</note> which doth not alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the perſon, but corrupteth the whole nature of man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The ſecond which is actuall ſynne, dwelleth in the body of the ſynner alone, and hurteth others, no otherwiſe then when they be pertakers therof, eyther by ioyning in facte, or conſente, by ſuffring or not regarding the poyſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the ende of both is <hi>death euerlaſting.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23</note> How horrible that ſynne is, the Scriptures doe tell.

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, he hath prepared him to be a <hi>Lyghte to the Gentyls, and the glory of Iſrael.</hi> Thrée things in the former Verſe are to be noted.

            <p>Chriſt is moſt worthyly called light, not onely bicauſe he is the engrauen forme and <hi>brightneſſe of the Father of lyghtes,</hi> but alſo bicauſe he giueth light,<note place="margin">Col. 1.15.

Of which light and illumination, the Euangeliſt Iohn ſpeaketh in the goſpell, ſaying:<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>In hym was lyfe, and this lyfe was the lyght of men, and thys lyghte did ſhine in darkneſſe, &amp; the darkneſſe did not comprehend it.</hi> By the worde life, he meaneth all liuing power, which at this daye is to be ſéene in all creatures, as well endued with naturall reaſon, ſpirituall wiſedome, as ſauage crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſenceleſſe things, trées, plantes, herbes, graſſe, corne, &amp;c. Eche of theſe hath his proper lyfe, and of Chriſt the Creator, the light and lyfe of all things. And for that no man ſhould ſuppoſe this lyght, whereof he ſpeaketh, to concerne the lyfe and lyght, which euer is common with the bodyes of men and beaſtes.

               <note place="margin">Eſa. 42.7.</note> 
               <hi>Symeon</hi> had reſpect (no doubt) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt a <hi>Lyght,</hi> to the Prophets which ſo ſpake of him: Namely that Noble Eſay,<note place="margin">Eſa. 42.6.</note> ſaying: <hi>I the Lorde haue called thee in righteouſneſſe, and wil holde thine hande, and I wyll keepe thee and guyde thee, for a couenant of the people, and for a lyght of the Gentyls, that thou mayeſt open the eyes of the blynde, and bring out the priſoner out from the priſon, and them that ſyt in darkneſſe, out of the priſon houſe.</hi> And againe:<note place="margin">Eſa. 49.6.</note> 
               <hi>It is a ſmale thing that thou ſhouldeſt bee my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to rayſe vp the Tribe of Iacob, and to reſtore the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Iſrael, I wyl alſo giue thee for a lyght to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyls, that thou mayeſt be my ſaluation vnto the ende of the worlde.</hi> Nowe in thys Parable, there be two things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the note. Firſt, that all men in themſelues, as well Iewes as Gentyls, be méere darkneſſe. The other, that God the Father in heauen and earth, hath giuen no other to illuminate mankinde, with the light of nature, of God and true godlyneſſe, but his onely begotten ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and him onely to the whole worlde, as hymſelfe wytneſſeth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.12.</note> ſaying: <hi>I am the light of the worlde.</hi> And moſt lyuely is our Chriſt repreſented by the glorious Sunne, which being in his Spheare farre aboue,<note place="margin">Chriſt our light, ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed forth by the Sunne.</note> performeth al his office enioyned him wythout default, to the circuits of the whole earth and Seas, and that to the endes of the world. And by the way note (good Reader) how the Lorde taketh apt occaſion by the tyme and place, where he is, to teache hymſelfe, that he is to the hartes of men. When he was at Iacobs Well with the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.10.</note> he tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Metaphor of water, to teache her the lycour of lyfe. By the deſyre the Iewes had to earthy bread, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:227:64"/> followed him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.15. Luc. 5.3.</note> he began to teach himſelf to be <hi>the bread of lyfe.</hi> And teaching in the ſhyp by that myracle of Fiſhes, he taught the Apoſtles the waye to catch men. The ſame thing he vſeth in theſe wordes: <hi>I am the lyght, &amp;c.</hi> For teaching in the morning in the Temple, the Sunne nowe ſhyning moſte brightly, bewtifying the place to the great delight of the beholders, he calleth them from the terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, affirming in him to finde the true properties of the glorious ſonne in déede. Firſt, as the Sunne is a moſt pure Planet, moſt bryght and cléere, defyled with nothing whereſoeuer it ſhyneth, but maketh the darke and fylthy places more open to the eyes of men: So Ieſus Chriſt, the <hi>brightneſſe of his fathers glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.15.</note> is of nature moſt pure and holye, and albeit he hath taken oure nature vpon him, lyued amongſt vs, did accompany wyth ſynners to their good, and abhorred not to eate with Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, yet was he nothing defyled therby, but by him theſe fylthy perſons made wholy to know themſelues, &amp; through him were illuminated and fully ſanctifyed. The Sunne, that is to ſay the light, doth ſo ſhyne, that himſelfe may be ſéene of vs, and doth make all other lyuing creatures to ſée by him: So Ieſus Chriſt our light, doth ſo manifeſtly in his nature appeare, that the inſenſible heauens and earth do know him, &amp; he doth ſo powre by his ſpirite, the beames of his brightneſſe into the hartes of hys beloued, that they by his ſpirite and reſplendiſhing Scriptures, both perfitly (as fleſhe may) know God the Father, and his Chriſt, and all things elſe, which be eyther neceſſary, or expedient to their ſaluation in him, beſydes whom <hi>there is none other.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.12. Pſal. 36.9.</note> Thys compelled Dauid to ſay: <hi>With thee (O Lord) is the Well of lyfe, and in thy lyght, ſhal we ſee lyght.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Through chriſts light we ſee God to be our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; hym the lord to be our Sauior.</note> And as the lyght diſcouereth darkeneſſe, and refreſheth the toyled bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, in former obſcuritie: Euen ſo Chriſt remouing the former ignorance of God in vs, banyſhing the terror of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doth moſt magnificently recreate our ſences, and
<pb facs="tcp:227:65"/> refreſhe our ſpirites, renouate our conſcience, quyet oure ſoule, and repleniſhe vs with ioye. And lyke as the lyghte doth not onely in darkneſſe of night guyde our footeſteps, but helpeth vs aright to our whole buſineſſe: So Chriſte that eternall worde of God, is the <hi>Lanterne to our feete, and the light</hi> to our labours,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> in that the doctrine and preceptes thence ſhyning to vs, doe direct our darke ſoules into the paths of righteouſneſſe, and that for his owne names ſake. And as light (banyſhing darkneſſe) openeth to mans eye many things, which in mircke midnight were not onely ſhadowed,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of light.</note> but alſo ſheltered and ſo vnknowne, that many adulters, théeues, murtherers and wicked perſons, by her were couered,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.19.</note> and nowe by light diſcloſed (for which cauſe naturally they loue darkneſſe &amp; hate the lyght) So Chriſt hauing by his worde of moſt cléereneſſe and heauenly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, banyſhed from Realmes, Familyes and perſons, the darknes of ignorance, maketh knowne to them their ſyns, and reproueth their errors, accuſeth the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mans nature, and playnely maketh vs ſée, that all thoſe things which without him we moſt imbraced, are moſt fylthye and horrible. And this is the cauſe, why all ſuch as wallow in wicked lyfe and falſe Religion, doe hate Chriſt in hys Goſpell to this preſent daye,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.19.</note> but to their vtter ruine and ſelfe condemnation. Laſtly, as one ſhyning Sunne ſerueth the vniuerſall worlde, and is the onely Fountayne of light to all lightes in the ſame: So the bright ſonne of God our righteouſneſſe Chriſt, is the onely author of ſpirituall light, whome the Father of lights hath onely giuen to the whole worlde. And he doth <hi>lighten euerye man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the worlde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.9.</note> neyther will he admit any copemate to be ioyned with him,<note place="margin">What church is not guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by our lyght Chriſt onely, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clypſed and bloudy to Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> but kéepeth the whole Regimente in and to himſelfe. For as the Moone (the figure of Gods Church) receyueth at the handes of the Sunne her lighte, and is ſo much darkned, as ſhe wanteth of his brightneſſe: So the Churche of God, not kept with the countenance
<pb facs="tcp:227:65"/> of Chriſts ſhyning face and Goſpell, is wrapped in the wayne of darkneſſe, but lightned by his truth, ſhe is moſt gloryous, and her naturall ſpottes ſhall not deface her: yet both Moone and Church remayne to be light by hym, elſe as oppoſite to him, they are eyther darke or bloody, or one or bothe. Let no man obiect to me,<note place="margin">Lightened by Chriſte, her ſpots do not hurt her.</note> that the Apoſtles are called alſo lightes <hi>of the worlde,</hi> for that hath the true light imported in mercye to them by borrowed ſpéeche, as we may call the Lanterne a light,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.26.27.</note> bicauſe the light ſhyneth by and through it, vnto the whole houſholde: And ſo are the Apoſtles called lights, not bicauſe they are the light Chriſt,<note place="margin">How the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and preachers of the worde, are called lighte.</note> but bicauſe they bring vnto vs the true light, that dwelleth in them, which doth alſo by them and their labours (preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wryting) ſhine into the vtmoſt partes of the earth, to the great comforte of all thoſe that loue the ſame. To conclude, great is the mercye of our good God, ſéeing the darkneſſe of the world ſo greate, that no otherwiſe it could be diſcouered &amp; remoued, gaue vnto vs this his owne ſon, whome he hath made to vs the onely light of God, to Iew and Gentyle, that we ſhould not for wante of ſafe conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, periſhe in our wandring paſſage.</p>
            <p>Now the vſe of thys light, and wherto he is giuen vs of God, <hi>Symeon</hi> doth tell vs and ſayth: it is that <hi>he ſhould be reuealed vnto the Gentyls, and to be the glory of the people Iſrael.</hi> Two things alſo the good father telleth vs in theſe words. Fyrſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ages from tyme to tyme ſhould knowe, that this one Chriſt is to all them, and people in them, the one and onely ſaluation, light, guyde and delyuerer,<note place="margin">Chriſt is to all ages, the the one and onely lyght to lyfe.</note> ſygni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the two Nations by him named, Iewe &amp; Gentyle. The lyke doth Eſay before naming the Gentyls, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>and health to the vtmoſt partes of the world.</hi> So Chriſt himſelfe concludeth, ſaying as before is ſaide: <hi>I am the lighte of the worlde,</hi> that is to ſaye, of euerye place in the worlde, of all ſortes of men, women and chyldren ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and whoſoeuer of theſe do deſyre and ſéeke at me aright
<pb facs="tcp:227:66"/> for health and lyfe. But ſayth <hi>Symeon,</hi> this light is ſent to be <hi>reuealed,</hi> &amp; made knowne to thys worlde. For the ſame cauſe Chriſt fyrſt preached it: Iohn Baptiſt and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſent to manifeſt him thereto, that as ſaluation was wrought by him: ſo they by fayth (which commeth by hearing the worde reuealed) might apprehend it in him. Of which more a little after, God ſo wylling.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly ſome man would aſke me, if Chriſt be the light and Sauiour of the whole worlde,<note place="margin">The cauſe of our great blindneſſe in ſo clere light</note> howe it is that ſo manye therein are notwithſtanding ſtill blynded, and ſo condemned?

               <hi>He that followeth mee, walketh not in darkneſſe.</hi> It is not ynnough that God hath made his ſonne our light, vnleſſe we embrace and walke therein.

               <hi>and men loued darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then the light.</hi> The nature of theſe men is, to hate the light, and to abſent themſelues from it, leaſt their déedes ſhould be made manifeſt thereby. Loe, it is not that theſe wante in the world that they hate it, but for that they luſt after their owne wyll, to lyue wickedly ſtill, &amp; therfore they refrayne it: yea, and to their power reſtrayne it alſo. But here they are conuinced in conſcience, that the goſpel is light, and they are the ſonnes of darkneſſe, drawing to themſelues damnation. I aſke againe, and if Chriſt be the light of the worlde,<note place="margin">The worlds darkeneſſe, what it is.</note> what is the darkneſſe then of the ſame: It is a profitable queſtion, and it may be aunſwered thus.

Wherfore we may conclude, that as ſyngle lyfe compelled, without conſyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to eche prieſt and miniſter of God, is without the will of God in his worde.

Wherevpon the Apoſtle thus concludeth. If any man ſpeake a ſtrange tongue, let it be by two or thrée at the moſt, and that by courſe, and let one interprete. But if there be no Interpretor, let him keepe ſilence in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (which ſpeaketh languages) and let him ſpeake to himſelfe and to God. No Laten in the Engliſh church, bicauſe it cannot edyfie thoſe, which vnderſtande it not, thoughe it be the ſcripture of God that is reade or prayed, vnleſſe there be to reueale it, and doe preſently interprete the ſame.

But that we eate not as our fyrſt Father Adam did, in earthly Paradiſe, it is fyt that we come as Bées, and not lyke vnto venemous Spyders. Let vs ſearch and ſéeke therein, the moſt ſwéete lycour of lyfe, the knowledge of God and his Chriſt, the knowledge of our ſynnes, the reward of them, the forgiueneſſe of them, by whome and the maner howe: The will of God, and the ſtrength to ſerue him orderly, the power of Satan and his wylie engins, and how to eſcape them: The weapons and armour of God, and how to be armed therewith, and by battayle (in our Captayne Chriſt) to beate downe Satan vnder our féete.

But if we come with mindes to cauill, foreſtuffed with errors, and bent to gather to féede our yll, we ſhall miſconſter the worde, for his truth is open to babes,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.15</note> that are content to take the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the parents mouth, and not to the worldly wyſe, and lyke learned, reſting in their owne wouen webbe of frayle humayne ſpynning.
